# HackDavis Mobile App Development Workshop Repo
This repository represents the work done at the 10/27 HackDavis workshop, where users were taught basic UI and Java skills for Android development, as well as how API requests work and how to make them in an Android app environment. 

## Getting Started 🚀
To get started, you can either clone this repository to your computer, or code yourself following our YouTube livestream. **Either way, make sure you first**: 
* Install Java if you don't already have it (**https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html**)
* Download Android Studio (**https://developer.android.com/studio**)
* Follow along with our PowerPoint presentation (**https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YR9GK3547V1cb_Tnwil-eaYY9kKibC0yywMe4IRPYjo/edit?usp=sharing**)
